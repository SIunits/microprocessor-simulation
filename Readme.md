# Basic Processor

You need to design and implement a small basic processor that performs the following operations:
- MinMax
- EvenOdd

When the `mode` is MinMax --> processor needs to read a list of three numbers and calculate the minimum and maximum ones.
When the `mode` is EvenOdd --> processor needs to return if the number is even or odd

## Example 1 - MinMax

Input:
[30, 22, 18]

Expected output 
max is 30 
min is 18

## Example 2 - EvenOdd

Input:
5

Expected output 
5 is an odd number

Hint: check how many utility functions you need -> one function per operation for example. Then use all function in a main one.
